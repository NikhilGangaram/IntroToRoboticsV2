Sensing and Following Lines: Module Overview
============================================

In this module students will:

* Understand the task of following a line with the robot
* Learn to use the reflectance sensor to detect the line
* Write simple programs for detecting and responding to lines
* Write simple programs to follow lines
* Enhance the simple program with better sensor measurements and calculations to
  follow the line more smoothly.

At the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Discuss robot navigation concepts with their classmates
* Get their robot to follow a line 
* Develop simple sensor logic control for robot decision making 

Covered Standards (NGSS and CSTA):
-----------------

**HS-ETS1-2** Break a complex real-world problem into smaller, more manageable problems that each can be solved using scientific and engineering principles.

**3A-AP-15** Justify the selection of specific control structures when tradeoffs involve implementation, readability, and program performance, and explain the benefits and drawbacks of choices made.

**3A-AP-16** Design and iteratively develop computational artifacts for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue by using events to initiate instructions.

**3A-AP-17** Decompose problems into smaller components through systematic analysis, using constructs such as procedures, modules, and/or objects.

**3B-CS-02** Illustrate ways computing systems implement logic, input, and output through hardware components.

**3B-AP-10** Use and adapt classic algorithms to solve computational problems.

**3B-AP-11** Evaluate algorithms in terms of their efficiency, correctness, and clarity.

**3B-AP-15** Analyze a large-scale computational problem and identify generalizable patterns that can be applied to a solution.

**3B-AP-16** Demonstrate code reuse by creating programming solutions using libraries and APIs.
