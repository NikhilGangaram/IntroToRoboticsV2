Activity: Trains!
=================
Now that you made your robot park, can you make it do these?


Activity 1: Following a moving wall
-----------------------------------
Set the robot to be a fixed distance from a wall, and do the same parking activity from before, but this time, try moving the wall. See if the robot will follow the wall well. Move it back and forth and your robot should follow. 

 

Activity 2: Making a Train
--------------------------
If they can follow walls... why can't they follow other robots? Try putting multiple robots, one behind another, and doing this same activity. In front of the first robot, put a wall, and make it move. Now, you've created a way to control all of these robots! 


Note that this train may break apart because the robots end up facing sideways after some time.
