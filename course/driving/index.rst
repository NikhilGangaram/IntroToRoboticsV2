Robot Driving: Module Overview
==============================

In this module students will:

* Learn how to make the robot drive at different speeds
* Understand the relationship between the wheel speeds and the robot's motion
* Be introduced to motor encoders and how to use them to measure the robot's movements
* Learn about the built in driving functions which help make complicated motions easy


At the end of this module, students will be able to...

* Make the robot drive in straight lines, turn corners, and turn in place
* Write and use basic functions in the Python programming language
* Use different types of loops in Python
* Break down a large, repetitive movement sequence into components and then convert into code

Covered Standards (NGSS and CSTA):
-----------------

**3A-AP-16** Design and iteratively develop computational artifacts for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue by using events to initiate instructions.

**3A-AP-17** Decompose problems into smaller components through systematic analysis, using constructs such as procedures, modules, and/or objects.

**3B-AP-16** Demonstrate code reuse by creating programming solutions using libraries and APIs.
