Robot Control: Module Overview 
==============================

In this module students will:

* Understand the basics of robot control and its application

At the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Implement simple controllers such as on-off controllers 
* Implement more complex controllers such as P controllers 
* Explain the difference between open-loop and closed-loop control


Covered Standards (NGSS and CSTA):
-----------------------------------

**HS-ETS1-2** Break a complex real-world problem into smaller, more manageable problems that each can be solved using scientific and engineering principles.

**3A-AP-16** Design and iteratively develop computational artifacts for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue by using events to initiate instructions.

**3A-AP-17** Decompose problems into smaller components through systematic analysis, using constructs such as procedures, modules, and/or objects.

**3B-CS-02** Illustrate ways computing systems implement logic, input, and output through hardware components.

**3B-AP-10** Use and adapt classic algorithms to solve computational problems.

**3B-AP-11** Evaluate algorithms in terms of their efficiency, correctness, and clarity.

**3B-AP-15** Analyze a large-scale computational problem and identify generalizable patterns that can be applied to a solution.

**3B-AP-16** Demonstrate code reuse by creating programming solutions using libraries and APIs.
