      " If your XRP (short for Raspberry Pi Robot) is going crazy while line-following, there could be several reasons. Here are some possibilities and suggestions for troubleshooting:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Incorrect wheel speed or motor control settings: Ensure that the set_effort(0.5) in your spin_wheels.py script is appropriate for your robot's motors. Adjust the value as needed, and make sure you're setting the correct left and right wheels separately if required.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Wiring issues: Check the connections between the motor controllers and the robot chassis to ensure that they are properly connected. Loose or faulty wires can cause unpredictable behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Motor controller problems: It's possible that there is an issue with your motor controllers, such as a short circuit or improper configuration. Try double-checking the motor controller settings and ensuring that it is receiving power correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Code errors: If you've recently made changes to your code, there may be a syntax error or other programming mistake causing the robot to behave unexpectedly. Make sure you have a good understanding of the XRPLib library and double-check any modifications you've made.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Software/firmware issues: Ensure that the software running on your Raspberry Pi (both the operating system and the motor controller firmware, if applicable) is up to date and functioning properly. Updating the software may help resolve unexpected behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Sensor calibration: If you're using sensors for line-following, make sure they are properly calibrated and functioning correctly. Incorrect readings from sensors can cause a robot to deviate from its intended path.\n",
      "\n",
      "To troubleshoot your XRP while line-following, start by addressing the most likely issues (like wiring or incorrect settings) before moving on to more complex problems like code errors or software/firmware issues. It may also be helpful to consult the documentation for the XRPLib library and your specific robot chassis and motor controllers for guidance. Good luck!\n"
